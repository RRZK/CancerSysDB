  <h1>About the CancerSysDB</h1>
  <br/>
  <p align="justify">The Cancer Systems Biology Database (CancerSysDB) is an information system for integrative data analysis of molecular cancer datasets across data types, across cancer types as well as across multiple cancer studies. The public instance contains published data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).</p>
  <p align="justify">Apart from using this public instance, scientists can establish a private instance of the CancerSysDB, link this instance to their own cancer genomics pipelines and thus set up their local infrastructure for data organisation and integrative analysis. This will finally speed up the computational procedures in clinical cancer research and open scientists enhanced perspectives on their data. The system is available for download as a WAR file which can be easily plugged into an existing Tomcat installation on a local server.</p>
  <p align="justify">The CancerSysDB is a joint effort of the CECAD bioinformatics platform at the University of Cologne/Germany, the bioinformatics Core Unit at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried/Germany. It was implemented at the Regional Computing Center of the University of Cologne/Germany (RRZK). The project is funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG).</p>
